# Ram-rtl-
A 256-byte synchronous RAM implementation in Verilog with parameterized depth and address size. Features include 4-operation command interface (hold address, write, read address, read data) through a 10-bit input protocol, reset functionality, and handshaking with valid signaling for reliable data transfers.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
RAM Memory Controller
A parameterized synchronous RAM implementation in Verilog HDL for embedded memory applications.
Overview
This project implements a flexible Random Access Memory (RAM) module with 16-bit data width and configurable depth. The design features synchronous read/write operations with clock enable control and full reset functionality. The memory module is designed for integration in larger digital systems where reliable and efficient memory access is required.
Features

Parameterized Design

Configurable memory width (16-bit default)
Adjustable memory depth (1024 entries default)
Flexible address size (10-bit default)


Synchronous Operation

All operations synchronized to the rising edge of the clock
Full reset capability
Independent read and write enables


Block Select Functionality

Memory can be enabled/disabled via block select input
Power-saving capability for unused memory blocks


Independent Read/Write Paths

Separate read and write address inputs
Dual-port-like functionality with separate control signals



Module Interface
verilogmodule Ram (
    din,         // Data input
    dout,        // Data output
    wr_en,       // Write enable
    rd_en,       // Read enable
    blk_select,  // Block select
    addr_rd,     // Read address
    addr_wr,     // Write address
    rst,         // Reset
    clk          // Clock
);
Operation
The RAM module operates as follows:

Reset: When rst is asserted (high), the data output is reset to 0.
Block Select: Memory operations are only enabled when blk_select is asserted.
Write Operation: When both blk_select and wr_en are high, data is written to the memory location specified by addr_wr.
Read Operation: When both blk_select and rd_en are high, data is read from the memory location specified by addr_rd and output on dout.

Implementation Example
The RAM module can be instantiated as follows:
verilogRam #(
    .MEM_WIDTH(16),
    .MEM_DEPTH(1024),
    .ADDR_SIZE(10)
) ram_inst (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .wr_en(wr_en),
    .rd_en(rd_en),
    .blk_select(blk_select),
    .din(din),
    .dout(dout),
    .addr_rd(addr_rd),
    .addr_wr(addr_wr)
);
Verification
The design is verified using a comprehensive testbench that:

Initializes the memory with predetermined values
Performs sequential write operations across the address space
Reads back the written values to verify write functionality
Tests block select functionality
Verifies reset operation

Applications
This RAM module is suitable for:

Data buffers in digital systems
Memory elements in processors and controllers
Cache memory implementations
FIFO and queue backing storage
